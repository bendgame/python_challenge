Py bank was pretty easy, even without data frames. 

My original solution for py poll didn't pull the names dynaically and had them hardcoded because I thought we could. After rereading the instructions and realizing that it should be dynamic, I rewrote the solution using pandas data frames. Much simpler solution.
